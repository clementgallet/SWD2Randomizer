# SWD2Randomizer
Randomizer for the game SteamWorld Dig 2

## What does the Randomizer do?

- It randomizes all upgrades on upgrade podiums (excluding the run boots) together with the three secret blueprints (Blood Quest, Thrillseeker's Tale and Deathplosions) and the triple grenade launcher.
- It randomizes all caves that have one entry
- It ensures that the resulting layout is possible to finish.
- It also makes some additional patches (see below)

There are two possible difficulties: `Casual` and `Speedrunner`. In `Speedrunner` difficulty, you may need to:

- Use double jumps and hook jumps
- Use grenade jumps
- Dig with Deathplosions or updated Pressure Bomb

## Additional patches

To ease the experience, a few other patches are applied to the game:

- The intro cutscene is skipped
- The first boss is always available to fight, even after doing the tutorial sequence break
- The map is available from the start
- The characters in El Machino are not stuck to the initial cutscene when doing the tutorial sequence-break
- The arrows arena from the ToG lower left cave is completed already
- The ignition axe damage against the boss guarding the ignition axe upgrade podium is fixed (it does 5% of base damage in the original game)
- The gate to the hook cave in Oasis is always open
- The triple grenade launcher price is reduced to 200
